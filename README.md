## Content

This is all about an introductory programming course that happens to use MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. These exercises as well as the course can help you ：

1. become familiar with general concepts in computer science
2. gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming
3. obtain a solid foundation in the use of MATLAB

MATLAB is a special-purpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderate-size programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers. The design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful program in a few lines. The problems may be relatively complex, while the MATLAB programs that solve them are relatively simple: relative, that is, to the equivalent program written in a general-purpose language, such as C++ or Java. As a result, MATLAB is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences through all disciplines of engineering to finance and beyond, and it is heavily used in industry. Hence, a solid background in MATLAB is an indispensable skill in today’s job market.

Nevertheless, this course is not a MATLAB tutorial. It is an introductory programming course that happens to use MATLAB to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming. 

This is an introductory college-level course in computer science for engineering and science students. However, it is also suitable for high school students who are interested in programming. The material assumes no background in mathematics beyond the standard high school curriculum. Students taking the course will get a MATLAB license free of charge for a three-month period. 



## Syllibus
